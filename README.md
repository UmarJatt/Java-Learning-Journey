# 🚀 My Java Learning Journey

In my **1st year, 2nd semester**, my subject was **OOP in Java**. I followed **CodeWithHarry's Java OOP playlist** 🎥 step by step and learned everything about **Java OOP**. This gave me a strong foundation in the **four pillars of OOP** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) and significantly strengthened my coding skills. 💪📚  

On **29.09.2025**, I **collected all the code I had written and saved in a folder during my 2nd semester** and created this repository 🗂️ named **Java Learning Journey**. I also used AI to make the code **more understandable and beginner-friendly**, not just for me, but for **everyone** who wants to learn. 🌟  

This repository is **published to guide learners** and help them understand Java OOP concepts practically. All codes are organized by **topics** and follow the **sequence of CodeWithHarry's playlist** for easy learning and reference. ✅

1. Java Variables & Data Types  
2. Operators and Expressions  
3. Control Statements (if-else, switch-case)  
4. Loops (for, while, do-while, for-each)  
5. Arrays & Multidimensional Arrays
